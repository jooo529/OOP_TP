<Mission 1>
You have to buy some fruitbox!
You can learn 'value and variable's relation' in this mission.
Each of fruits means value
and each of boxes means variable
If you try to put big fruit
in small box, fruit will go to pieces! 
So, you have to put each fruit in proper box!
(= you have to put value in proper variable!)
